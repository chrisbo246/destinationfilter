Image-Select
============

We designed this plugin extension as a humanized UI element for social networking sites that need to faciliate relations between people. Research shows that people are extremely sensitvie to photos of others, so we needed to revamp the traditional UI elements to make them more intuitive and human.

Version 1.3
- Updated (29 March 2015)
- Works with Chosen 1.1, http://github.com/harvesthq/chosen

You can use these plugin extensions for modelling multiple (one-to-many) or single (one-to-one) relations between people.

We couldn't find any scripts that had this full functionality, so we developed it ourselves on top of Chosen. 

Hope you find it helpful, and get back if you have any feedback/improvements.
